Postmortem: Web Stack Outage

Issue Summary
- Duration: June 8, 2024, 14:00 - 16:30 UTC
- Impact: The primary web application was down, preventing users from accessing the website. Approximately 75% of users experienced service disruption.
- Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the Apache web serverâ€™s wp-settings.php file that led to a syntax error, causing the server to return a 500 Internal Server Error.

Timeline
- 14:00 UTC: Issue detected by automated monitoring system, triggering an alert.
- 14:05 UTC: I received the alert and confirmed the outage.
- 14:10 UTC: Initial investigation focused on recent code deployments, suspecting a faulty update.
- 14:30 UTC: Rolled back the latest deployment, but the issue persisted.
- 15:00 UTC: Noticed a high number of 500 errors in the Apache logs, indicating a server-side problem.
- 15:15 UTC: Investigated Apache configuration files, including httpd.conf and wp-settings.php.
- 15:30 UTC: Identified a typo (phpp instead of php) in wp-settings.php.
- 15:45 UTC: Corrected the typo and restarted the Apache server.
- 16:00 UTC: Verified the fix and confirmed the website was back online.
- 16:30 UTC: Issue resolved and all systems operational.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a typo in the wp-settings.php file where phpp was mistakenly written instead of php. This syntax error caused Apache to return a 500 Internal Server Error.

Resolution:

Identified and corrected the typo in the wp-settings.php file.
Restarted the Apache server to apply changes.
Verified functionality by making GET requests to ensure the server responded with the correct HTML content.
Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements:
To prevent such issues in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

1) Enforce stricter code review processes to catch typos and syntax errors.
2) Introduce automated testing for PHP syntax validation before deployments.
3) Enhance monitoring to detect and alert on specific error patterns quickly.
4) Update incident response procedures to include configuration file checks.

Tasks:

1) Patch Configuration Files: Review and correct any similar issues in configuration files.
2) Add Syntax Checking: Integrate a syntax checking tool in the CI/CD pipeline.
3) Update Monitoring: Implement detailed monitoring for Apache error logs.
4) Conduct Training: Educate developers on common configuration issues and best practices.
5) Review Incident Response Plan: Revise the incident response plan based on lessons learned.
By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar issues and ensure a more robust and reliable service for our users.
Ah, typos â€“ the tiny gremlins of the programming world! They sneak in when you least expect it and cause havoc, reminding us that even in the world of technology, the smallest things can have the biggest impacts. Cheers to catching them quickly and learning from the experience! ðŸ˜‰

Project Overview
In this project, I embarked on a journey to deepen my understanding of API interactions, particularly focusing on reading documentation, handling pagination, parsing JSON, making recursive calls, and sorting data structures. This readme outlines what I've learned and how I applied these concepts throughout the project.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I have achieved the following learning objectives, and I am now able to explain these concepts to anyone without needing to refer to Google:

General Objectives
How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for: I learned how to navigate and interpret API documentation effectively. This skill allowed me to locate the specific endpoints I needed for various tasks, understand the parameters required, and identify the format of the responses.

How to use an API with pagination: Many APIs return large sets of data spread across multiple pages. I mastered the technique of handling such paginated responses, ensuring that I could retrieve complete datasets by making successive requests for each page of data.

How to parse JSON results from an API: APIs commonly return data in JSON format. I gained proficiency in parsing these JSON responses, enabling me to extract and manipulate the data as needed for my project.

How to make a recursive API call: Sometimes, a single API call is not enough to gather all required information. I learned how to implement recursive API calls, which allowed me to continue making requests until all necessary data was obtained.

How to sort a dictionary by value: Organizing data efficiently is crucial. I learned how to sort dictionaries by their values, a skill that proved useful in managing and presenting the data I retrieved from the APIs.

Project Description
In this project, I applied the aforementioned skills in a practical context. Here’s a brief overview of how each objective was integrated into the project:

Reading API Documentation:
I started by selecting an API and thoroughly reading its documentation. This step was crucial for understanding the available endpoints and how to use them effectively.
Using an API with Pagination:
I encountered datasets that were too large to be returned in a single response. By implementing pagination techniques, I was able to iteratively request and compile data from all pages.
Parsing JSON Results:
Once I received data from the API, I used JSON parsing methods to break down the response into usable components. This included extracting specific fields and transforming the data into a more workable format.
Making Recursive API Calls:
I faced scenarios where additional data was linked from the initial response. To handle this, I implemented recursive calls, ensuring that I fetched all linked data without manual intervention.
Sorting Dictionaries by Value:
After gathering the data, I often needed to sort it based on certain values. I wrote functions to sort dictionaries, which helped in presenting the data in a meaningful and organized manner.
Conclusion
This project was a significant learning experience. It equipped me with the skills to efficiently interact with APIs, handle complex data retrieval scenarios, and process the data for practical use. The hands-on approach to learning these concepts has made me confident in my ability to apply them in real-world situations.
